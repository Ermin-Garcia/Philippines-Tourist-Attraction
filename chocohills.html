                    The hills are located throughout the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan
                    and consist of about 1,776 mounds of the same general shape. During the 
                    dry season when precipitation in inadequate, the grass-covered hills turn
                    chocolate brown, hence the name in reference to a branded confection.                    
                    Bohol, island, Visayan group, south-central Philippines. The island, roughly
                    oval in shape, lies between the Camotes Sea (north) and the Bohol Sea (south).
                    Its volcanic core is mostly covered with coralline limestone.

                    Tarsiers have the largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. 
                    Each eyeball is around 16 millimeters in diameter, which is as large 
                    as the tarsier's entire brain. The eyes are so large that they can't 
                    rotate them. Instead, tarsiers can twist their necks a full 180 degrees 
                    in either direction, just like owls.

                    branch. The province of Bohol seems to encourage the bizarre. It contains 
                    one of the world's strangest landscapes, a collection of some 1,700 hills 
                    in a 20-square-mile area called the Chocolate Hills.
