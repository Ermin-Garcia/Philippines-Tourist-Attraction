                    The Banaue Rice Terraces are a National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines 
                    and are considered to be the 8th Natural Wonder of the World by many Filipinos.
                    The terraces are carved in the mountains of Ifugao and were most likely done by hand.                        
                    There have been rice terraces in the mountainous regions of Ifugao and northern 
                    Luzon Island for over 2,000 years. The terraces were first constructed as a practical 
                    solution to the problem of growing rice on land that falls away in front of you at 
                    vertigo-inducing angles.

                    The Ifugao way of life is highly dependent on natural resources. The Ifugao 
                    culture is harmoniously interwoven with the mountain ecosystem. Their rice 
                    culture and natural forests, wood carving and associated indigenous knowledge
                    systems are highly dependent on the sustainability of the natural resources 
                    ecosystem.
